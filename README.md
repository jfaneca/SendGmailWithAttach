# SendGmailWithAttach
The code uses a csv file (really comma separated fields) for sending an email with attachment using a gmail email account.

The first field is the email address, the second is the file name to be used as email attachment.

## Note
In order to allow your gmail account to be used by this app, you need to go to your gmail account, option "Manage your Google account" / "Security" and you need to turn ON "less secure app" feature
